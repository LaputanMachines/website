### Personal Portfolio Website

The source code and documentation for my personal website and blog. Hosts portfolio sections for all my miscellaneous projects as well as my professional work experience. 
If Jekyll is installed, you can serve the Jekyll site locally by typing the following into your BASH terminal: `jekyll serve &` This will build and run the site locally on port 4000 (i.e. `localhost:4000`), and optionally run the server in the background.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment and...
bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve  # Execute the local server
```
