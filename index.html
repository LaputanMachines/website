					I like to make things. I started off making mods for The Sims 2, Deus Ex, and The Movies. After a lengthy hiatus (I played a lot of video games), I decided to float around, taking on miscellaneous projects and freelance web dev contracts. I has a bad habit of revisiting long-completed projects with the goal of completely redoing them: this site was redone over ten times (as of fall 2016). I doesn't know why this happens, but I'm convinced that it's not entirely healthy. Maybe it's the caffeine.
