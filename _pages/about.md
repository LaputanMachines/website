Hello! I'm Michael Bassili!
I'm a software engineer and cloud architect with a versatile background spanning data engineering, backend development, and cloud computing. 
I've built cool things with AWS, Azure and GCP. I've been working in tech since 2017. 
I do a lot of things, but I'm most passionate about building scalable, reliable, and secure cloud-native applications.
_Most importantly_, I try to be a good human being and help others whenever I can.

Beyond my work in technology, I'm deeply committed to building better communities. 
I believe that everyone deserves to live in an affordable, equitable, and financially secure city. 

I'm the co-founder and active member of Strong Towns Nanaimo, a grassroots organization working to create more financially resilient, sustainable, and equitable cities. 
Our work focuses on urban planning and development that prioritizes people over cars, supporting housing affordability through missing middle housing, and working to make our streets safer for all users. 

I've been fortunate to work with some amazing people and companies. 
At the end of the day, I'm just a guy who loves to learn and build things.
This blog is a place for me to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings with the world.
